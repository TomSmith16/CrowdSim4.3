This Project:
- More than 2 random navigation points
	- changed flip-flop B to selecting a new point once it is reached and keep the cycle going rather than bounce between the two points.
- Textures
- Text overhead, trying to display variables from C++ class, might have to recreate PMME model as a Blueprint
